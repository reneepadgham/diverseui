    <h1>Why</h1>
    <h4>
      Who we assume our users are, and how we represent that in our visuals, affects who those users turn out to be.
      We want those users to be diverse, so we created Diverse UI, where you can find images representative of a diverse population.
      You can read more about why we think diversity in UI mockups is important <a href="https://medium.com/@reneepadgham/techs-diversity-problem-isn-t-only-in-the-hiring-numbers-edf00f7b5e95" target="_blank">here.</a>

    <h1>Known Shortcomings</h1>
    <h4>
      Finding these images wasn’t easy. They aren’t perfect. We avoided caricatures, but that doesn’t mean some images don’t feel a bit exaggerated, staged, or professional.
      We didn’t have a good way to recognize or account for preferred gender representation. In fact, <a href="/submit">submitting your photo</a> is one of the best ways to help out.
      You can help us make the most awesome set of real people on the internet.
