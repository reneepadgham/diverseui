    <h1>Why</h1>
    <h4>
      Who we assume our users are, and how we represent that in our visuals, affects who those users turn out to be.
      We want those users to be diverse, so we created Diverse UI, where you can find images representative of a diverse population.
      For more information, we wrote <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/techs-diversity-problem-isn-t-only-in-the-hiring-numbers-edf00f7b5e95" target="_blank">a blog post</a> about why we think diversity in UI mockups is important.

    <h1>Known Shortcomings</h1>
    <h4>
      Finding these images wasnâ€™t easy. They arenâ€™t perfect. We avoided caricatures, but that doesnâ€™t mean some images donâ€™t feel a bit exaggerated, staged, or professional.
      We didnâ€™t have a good way to recognize or account for preferred gender representation. In fact, <a href="{{ url_for('submit') }}">submitting your photo</a> is one of the best ways to help out.
      You can help us make the most awesome set of real people on the internet.

    <h2>How can I have my photo removed?</h2>
    <h4>E-mail us at <a href="mailto:hello@diverseui.com?subject=Remove%20Photo">hello@diverseui.com</a> with the image!
